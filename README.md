# New-Project01

I built a new TRIBUTE PAGE using HTML and CSS only

This is my very first project I ever done in my life and I am so amazed of the result. This has given me the strength and commitment to continue doing more and more and stay consistent in my coding.

I used the Safari as Web browser and Visual Studio Code ( VS Code ) as Text editor.

I then created a new folder on my browser and named it TRIBUTE PAGE1. Inside it, I created two folders, one named "MyWebsite1" with a file called "style.css" and another one called "TributePage1" with a file called "index.css". And finally, I opened my folder "TRIBUTEPAGE1" using VS Code and started coding from thereðŸ‘Œ

P.S.  I have also used Codepen.io for this project. 

# Index.html

Fistly, I opened the index.html and wrote the <! DOCTYPE html></html> tab
I linked the stylesheet to show my css style and referred it to "MyWebsite" folder I created.

In my Header, I used a div class that i named "container", where I stored the title " Francis N - UFC Heavyweight champion " as my h1 element, the id image with an anchor tag to reference the link of the image and another id image-caption as my h2 element.

Next, it's another div class called "box-2" which contain my first paragraph with an id tribute info, my h3 elements and my unorderd lists.
